We were thinking of buying an investment property in Slovakia. 
From an investor perspective, we cared about yield.
A good proxy on year is the comparison of Buy price to Rental price, we measure it in Rental years to pay off the Buy price, i.e. years to breakeven (YtB).

We found out that YtB is usually between 20 to 25 years,
and it's higher in richer regions like capitals and big cities.
